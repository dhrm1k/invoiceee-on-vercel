### Invoiceee

  

It's been a while I made a lil project called invoiceee to share custom invoices over the web (to be honest, it was just a toy project.). After replit ended their legacy hosting, the project is now on vercel. One of the things I explored working on it is Jinja templating. I will try something else too with Jinja too. I liked it.
